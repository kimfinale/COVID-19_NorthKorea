### Define variables used in this package
This will need to be run every time I makes changes to the package or the dataset.
```{r }
# devtools::load_all()
POP <- readRDS("inst/extdata/pop_by_province_20230213.rds")
DAT <- readRDS("data/covid_overall_20230122.rds")
unreported <-
    DAT$cumul_symptomatic[1] - DAT$symptomatic[1]

PARAMETERS <- initialize_params(pop=sum(POP$Total))
OBS <- c(unreported, DAT$symptomatic[1:PARAMETERS$obslength])

usethis::use_data(POP, overwrite=TRUE)
usethis::use_data(DAT, overwrite=TRUE)
usethis::use_data(PARAMETERS, overwrite=TRUE)
usethis::use_data(OBS, overwrite=TRUE)


```

### Natural history of infection

# p.999 Infectious virus was detected up to 9 days after diagnosis; the highest proportion of virus isolates (41.7%) was found in samples collected 2–5 days after diagnosis 
dur = 3.5 # 2-5 days
r = -log(0.417)/dur

# The PCR positivity rate on days 5, 7, 10, and 14 was 96.4% (53/55), 87.3% (48/55), 74.545% (41/55), and 41.8% (23/55) consecutively, whereas the viral culture positivity rates were 83% (44/53), 52% (26/50), 13.5% (7/52), and 8% (4/50).

# The mean latent period of 467 Omicron infections was 2.65 (95%CI: 2.53-2.78) days, and 98% of infections were positive for nucleic acid detection within 6.37 (95%CI: 5.86-6.82) days after infection. The mean incubation period of 335 symptomatic infections was 3.40 (95%CI: 3.25-3.57) days, and 97% of them developed clinical symptoms within 6.80 (95%CI: 6.34-7.22) days after infection.
